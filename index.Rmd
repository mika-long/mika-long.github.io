Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I^[![profile](profile.jpg)Photo taken by Saha Vishwanath at [teamLab Borderless Shanghai](https://borderless.teamlab.art/shanghai/).] am a Ph.D. candidate at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), fortunate to be advised by Professor [Matthew Kay](https://www.mjskay.com/). 

Before joining Northwestern, I was a student at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/), where I majored in Computer Science and Economics.

## Research

I am interested in developing both theoretical frameworks and practical tools for the robust evaluation of information visualization. I had also worked on questions that involve more economics and fairness concerns previously. 

My CV (last updated Mar 2024) is [here](https://mika-long.github.io/grad_cv.pdf).
