Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I[^1] am a third-year PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), fortunate to be advised by Professor [Matthew Kay](https://www.mjskay.com/) and Professor [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/). Before joining Northwestern, I was a student at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/), where I majored in Computer Science and Economics.

## Research

I am broadly interested in topics that lie at the intersection between theory and information visualization. Previously, I was also interested in solving questions that involve more economics and fairness concerns.

My CV (last updated Mar 2023) is [here]().
